# Functions

`Definition`: A block of code used to perform a specific function.

There are 3 parts to a Function:
1. Declaration
2. Definition
3. Call

```java
int add (int a, int b) {
    int s = a+b;
    return s;
}
add()
```
Here, 
- `int add()` is the `function declaration`
- `{....}` is the `function definition`
- `add()` is the `function call`

### Types of Functions

We can name 4 types of functions based on its params and return type:

1. with `@param` and with `return type`
2. with `@param` and without `return type`
3. without `@param` and with `return type`
4. without `@param` and without `return type`
